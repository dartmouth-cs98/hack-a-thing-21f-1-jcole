# React Native Tutorial Hack


## What you built? 

For this tutorial, I built 2 separate apps following along with a great tutorial I found on Youtube. Utilizing React Native and React Hooks (which were really a bonus as a part of this tutorial), I coded and debugged myself. I enjoyed how flexible react native was and found core react features to be intuitive to use and helpful with mobile development (even moreso than Android Studio in my opinion since styling is built in)

### App 1: Simple Goal Application 
<br />

For this application, users can input text into a modal text box and upon submitting, that text is displayed in a scrollable list view. When users click on an item, that item is deleted. I closely followed the tutorial on this app, and it was rewarding to produce a functional react native application.

### App 2: Number Guesser Game
<br />

For this multi-page application, users can submit a number between 1 and 99 (validated), and the app attempts to guess that number. This was a fun app because it involved both many pages of React Native, and also some game logic that was fun to implement. I also followed the tutorial closely, but found myself anticipating code to implement, and despite quite a bit of time spent debugging, I beleive after this app, I gained a much better understanding of the topic I was trying to learn.

## Who Did What?

I completed this hack alone.

## What you learned

### What I Learned / What Worked

While I haven't used React in a little while, I found that foundation to be extremely helpful syntactically, even though there were lots of new components to learn. While I took Android Programming last year, I am happy to have learned a framework that is flexible to iOS apps as well. I really enjoyed and found myself understanding much better the backend logic behind the apps, and can definitely see myself working more on this part of a larger project as well.

### What I Learned / What Didn't Work

The most challenging part of this project was getting Expo (a pre-built wrapper for React Native) and the emulator to function correctly. I did however spin my wheels enough to figure these components out and it did make the rest of the development much more enjoyable. I also found design and styling to be particularly difficult for me, and if not for the tutorial giving suggestions on how to design certain pages, I think this would have taken me much longer. I am happy to report, though, that I am much more comfortable with this part of the app as well, and while I did not enjoy this part as much, I would like to learn more about it. Thankfully, by following the tutorial not too much was able to go wrong, but I have also gained some experience in debugging this type of code as well.
